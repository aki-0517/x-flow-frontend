# xFlow

## Overview

The xFlow is a platform that allows developers to upload and monetize their API services (via OpenAPI YAML files) or context resources (MCP) with a flexible pay-per-use model powered by the xFlow protocol. By leveraging HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status codes, the platform enables real-time, machine-native transactions using stablecoins like USDC, eliminating the need for API keys, subscriptions, or manual payment processing.

## Key Features

- **Resource Analysis**: Automatically analyze OpenAPI YAML files and context resources to extract structure, endpoints, and value.
- **Flexible Pricing Models**: Set detailed pricing based on endpoints, data volume, processing time, context freshness, and more.
- **xFlow Protocol Integration**: Built-in support for the xFlow payment protocol with HTTP 402 responses and cryptographic signature verification.
- **Stablecoin Payments**: Accept micropayments in USDC and other stablecoins across various blockchain networks.
- **Simulation Tools**: Model potential revenue based on different usage patterns and optimize pricing strategies.
- **Resource Publication**: Manage the publication status of your APIs and context resources with automatic documentation generation.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track usage, revenue, and transaction metrics in real-time.

## Benefits

- **True Usage-Based Billing**: Charge exactly for what is used, down to individual API calls or context chunks.
- **Micropayments**: Enable new business models with ultra-low-value transactions that were previously impractical.
- **Instant Settlement**: Receive payments in real-time without invoicing or payment processing delays.
- **AI-Agent Ready**: Designed for seamless integration with AI agents and autonomous systems.
